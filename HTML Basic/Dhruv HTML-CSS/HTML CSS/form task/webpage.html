    <h1>Here we are discussing about the Union Territories of India.</h1>

    <p>India has a unique administrative structure, comprising 28 states and 8 union territories. Union territories are areas directly governed by the Central Government of India, as opposed to states, which have their own governments. The 8 union territories of India are: <span>Andaman and Nicobar Islands</span>,<span>Chandigarh</span>,<span> Dadra and Nagar Haveli</span> and <span> Daman and Diu</span>,<span> Jammu and Kashmir</span>,<span> Ladakh</span>,<span> Lakshadweep</span>,<span> Puducherry</span>, and <span> Delhi</span>. These territories were formed through various reorganizations and mergers over the years.</p>

    <p>Historically, some union territories were created from former princely states, Portuguese and French colonies, and even parts of states that were reorganized based on linguistic lines. For instance, Andaman and Nicobar Islands were acquired from the British, while Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu were formerly Portuguese territories. Puducherry, on the other hand, was a French enclave that was transferred to India in 1954.</p>

    <p>In recent years, significant changes have taken place. The Jammu and Kashmir Reorganisation Act, 2019, led to the conversion of Jammu and Kashmir from a state to two union territories: Jammu and Kashmir, and Ladakh. This change came into effect on October 31, 2019. Similarly, the union territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu were merged into a single entity on January 26, 2020.</p>
        
    <p>Union territories are governed by administrators appointed by the President of India, with the exception of Delhi, which has a Lieutenant Governor. These administrators are responsible for implementing Central Government policies and ensuring the smooth functioning of public services in these territories. Despite their unique status, union territories play an important role in Indiaâ€™s federal structure, serving as a bridge between the Central Government and the states.</p>
