        <h1>WEB-DESIGN</h1>
        <p>There is no underestimating the value of a website that looks good, functions efficiently, and ranks highly in search engines. A high performing website can mean the difference between a thriving and a struggling business.

        <h1>What is Web Design?</h1>
        <p>Web design is the process of planning, conceptualizing, and arranging content online. Today, designing a website goes beyond aesthetics to include the websiteâ€™s overall functionality. Web design encompasses everything from the overall look and feel of the website, the user interface (UI), the user experience (UX), and the site's performance including loading time and SEO.</p>
        <p>There are many different ways to design a website. If you can dish out the cash, some businesses hire a designer to design the appearance of the site, and then hire a developer to make the website come to life through coding. But if you'd rather do it yourself and save tons of cash, there are many no-code web design tools on the market today that make it easy for non-technical users to build a website using pre-built, customizable templates.</p>
        <p>As stated above, web design is more than just appearance to include functionality. Did you know that web design can have a huge impact on your performance in search engines like Google? This article will give you some helpful insight into how to create a website that not only looks good, but functions properly and ranks highly in search.</p>
